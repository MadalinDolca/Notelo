# üìù Notelo

This is the second Android app I've made, and the first one that uses the Kotlin programming language. It follows the Single-Activity and Clean architecture.

Notelo is a note-taking app that helps you stay organized by allowing you to create and categorize notes in a way that makes sense to you. With Notelo you can create notes, put them in categories and
group them by tags, making it easy to manage and find the notes you need.

## ‚ú® Features

- Organize notes into categories for easy browsing
- Group notes by tags for quick filtering
- Sync your notes across devices using your account
- Customize the app with themes and settings

## üîú Coming soon

- Create notes with rich text formatting and attachments
- Search for notes using keywords or tags
- Discover new notes with a curated feed of popular notes
